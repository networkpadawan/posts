So...Last day of the year. What can I tell about it? Well, overall it was a good one. Passed the CCNP Voice cert, got my CAP (training aptitude diploma), started dating:) ... a lot of good things indeed! The only minus that i can tell is being still on the same job...but until something better appears, I must endure.

On the tech side of thing, the iPad is kicking serious ass, but android with 3.0 might (and will) become a good adversary with meego being still in the alpha, the first 2 will be the adopted platforms, at least for now.

In 2011 I believe 3 things will become trends:

- Home Telepresence - Skype, cisco, and even Vodafone are giving it a start and if early adopters approve it... it´ll get interesting.

- IPv6 - remember Y2K? well, this one is the sequel.

- Tablet adoption - which will lead to better OS´s because who cares about the HW side? every vendor will make one...so OS is the part to care, Android OS 3.0, Meego 1.3, IOS 4.3/5.0, and Windows Phone 7 tablet version will arise as far as i can tell (windows 7 was not meant for touch).

- Cloud Computing - because it already is a trends, i just give it  an honorable mention, because right now it´s on it´s peak, but it will fade way as 2011 passes...

That´s my predictions anyway, maybe i´ll be right maybe i won´t.

Because next year will be the year of the tablets, i must follow the trend i buy one, for now my choice is the archos 101, but with CES 2011 at the door, i might change my mind, as far as tablets go. In the smartphone area I still have my N900 and I´m quite happy with it, but an upgrade is in order only if another qwerty slider appears,  with a dual core and more ram, a resistive good screen, and meego/android (i pushed the maemo adoption, but must face facts - maemoOS is dying).

As far as 2011  goes, i´ll try to slash more things out of my [list](http://www.blog.networkpadawan.com/o-desafio-101-em-1001/), finish my CCNP, get in the university, start a new job(!)  and begin a new geeky thing, a 365-photo-a-day project (more on that later).

Well, gotta go, as you can see I have a lot to do, so see ya´ll later and may you have an awesome 2011!
