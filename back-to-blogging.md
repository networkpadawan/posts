Hello and welcome to my new house! Like what I've done with the place? 

I have returned from the *offliners* because I need somewhere to post a few study notes (mostly networking), news I might find interesting and pieces of code I'm learning and blogging be a good medium to organize and share the knowledge.

Because of me needing to learn software development, I decided to go old school and not use Wordpress. Instead I'm using a static blog generator called [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican). It's based on python which is the programming language I'm learning.

Since this is all static, any bugs/errors you might find, please report them to me. Thanks!!

I might do a series of posts on how-to install and configure it, but for now this is it.
