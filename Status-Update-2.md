So, i´ve remodeled my blog yet again. added features:

- plugin to smartphones (checks user agent, improving the blog for mobile platforms)

- social interactions,

- disqus will manage the comments from now on(akismet will remain for spam purposes);

- auto post to twitter & facebook;

- button to "share on facebook" by the users;

- language, because my english is getting rusty and rustier, i´ll start posting in English, but fell free to comment in any language you want!

that´s it for the blog changes. As for myself, I´ve just recenty became a CCNP Voice Certified (Hell yeah) and now i´m studying for the CCNP and JNCIA (check my progress in my [study notes blog](http://study.networkpadawan.com).

please comment for changes you would like to see!
