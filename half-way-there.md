Well...that was fast, half a year has come and gone and I haven´t gotten that much done. Well, i did get a good enough grade to enter the university, but it´s still step 1 of 3 because they stil have to grade my C.V. and conduct an enterview with me. As certifications go, i´ll try to get the JNCIA during the summer (reading ospf rfc is a pain!) and start the CCNP, the ROUTE exam also asks for ospf, so it´s 2 for 1.

My tech predictions were/are kinda right, because:

IPv6 is getting more and more mainstream talk.

Tablet adoption is here, everybody is thinking on it. I bought an ipad:) woot!

Cloud "stuff" is the new web 2.0

Home Telepresence is the one that might be a hit & miss, skype was bought by Microsoft, umi from cisco most certanly will get the axe so let´s see how that goes...

As far as job hunting goes, it´s getting frustating because no one awnsers they´re own ads, but with university in the horizon and the economic crysis in Portugal, stability is a must, and that I have.

The 365 Project is with a little delay, but you can check the progress so far @

That´s it for now, stay tuned and i´ll promise to updade more often:)
