Next up in CCNP  is EIGRP, as always, a wp page with everything I learn/find will be available here.


#### Implement an EIGRP based solution, given a network design and a set of requirements





	
  * Determine network resources needed for implementing EIGRP on a network

	
  * Create an EIGRP implementation plan

	
  * Create an EIGRP verification plan

	
  * Configure EIGRP routing

	
  * Verify EIGRP solution was implemented properly using show and debug commands

	
  * Document results of EIGRP implementation and verification


Please comment with anything that comes to mind!
