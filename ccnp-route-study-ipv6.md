I´ll start my ccnp study with ipv6. From the reference notes provided by cisco i´ll need to know:


#### Implement an IPv6 based solution, given a network design and a set of requirements





	
  * Determine network resources needed for implementing IPv6 on a network

	
  * Create an IPv6 implementation plan

	
  * Create an IPv6 verification plan

	
  * Configure IPv6 routing

	
  * Configure IPv6 interoperation with IPv4

	
  * Verify IPv6 solution was implemented properly using show and debug commands

	
  * Document results of IPv6 implementation and verification plan


apart from the "planing" toppics ill be using cbt nuggets videos (ccna refresg and the new ccnp videos) and several links i´ve been collecting. i will post everything about ipv6 on a page for easier and better editing.
