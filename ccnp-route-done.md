So, I passed and with a good score too. The exam is tough and looks like Trivial Pursuit - routing edition. It asked me questions that don´t make sense like dual redistribution, or asked for topics like iBGP that were not supposed to be on the exam. Luckily I was prepared enough to take it all. For reference I read



	
  * Cisco Press - Official Certification Guide

	
  * Cisco Press - Foundation learning for the ROUTE

	
  * Watched both INE and CBTNuggets

	
  * and a lot of labbing with GNS3/IOU
