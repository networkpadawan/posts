EIGRP can set manual neighbors butÂ enabling manual disables automatic discovery

Frame relay can emulate point-2-point with the usage of subinterfaces, even so if only one dlci stays up the neighbor stays up until the hold timer expires.

  * disabled on physical interfaces

	
  * enabled on sub interfaces


Bandwidth concerns

Because eigrp uses by default 50% of a link, it can easily oversubscribe a fractional T1/E1. Also EIGRP divides the interface evenly between the number of neighbors.

To correct go to the interface and manually set the bandwidth.

As a guideline use the value of the lowest CIR to the calculations or use a point-to-point design
