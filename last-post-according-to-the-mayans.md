Well, the final strectch of 2011 is upon us all, and this year was a rollercoaster ride. I got a new job, get into university and will get out of there sooner than expected, finished some projects and hanged others...well if you´d ask me I did more than I was expecting.

As far as the new job goes, WOO HOO. At last I got a new job, and a good one at that. I´m doing a lot of great things, from linux to voip and networking. I´m loving it. and the fact that i left the headsets to die a very slow death, I couldn´t be happier. Really.

The university is another beast altogether. I got in, only to find that it´s only about software engeneering. I mean, c´mon! 3 years of java?  not for this guy so most probably I´ll stick to networking/cisco cert´s ...

On other failures, another one was the 365 project...it just fell through to the gutter, sadly because in some days I just didn´t feel like taking a picture and had to force myself to take 2 or 3 on the same day to compensate and afteer a while it felt like cheating...

As far as 2012 goes, the economic crisis worries, mainly because my job is on a contract and the employment rate in Portugal is ever so decreasing and it won´t get better any time soon. On the personal side, my 101 in 1001 was more than 1/3 completed, but it was poorly executed and I´ll have to arrange a new one, this time with some real priorities and objectives instead of plain wishes...

On a paradoxical note I will have to upgrade my 4 year imac, so it´s "save ALL the money" for me all year long, and wait for the imac refresh to be worth the upgrade...

To end this status updates, i´ll leave my tech predictions for 2012



	
  * RIM gets bought / ends it smartphone business and focus on the BES/services side of things

	
  * IPv6 sadly still a no show

	
  * Yadayadacloud gets more hype

	
  * Half dozen new security holes get discovered

	
  * New IPhone/IPad! :)

	
  * WP7 gets more adoption and starts eating the android pie

	
  * The year of the smartTV?




Happy 2012 to whomever is out there wasting time reading this:)
